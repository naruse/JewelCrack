    <p>Welcome to Jewel Crack, the ultimate relaxation game that combines classic match-three gameplay with innovative poke or gaze and pinch controls!</p>

    <p>Immerse yourself in a world of sparkling gems and endless fun. Your objective is simple: match at least three gems of the same color to crack them and score points. But beware, the clock is ticking! The faster you crack the gems, the higher your score multiplier will soar. Challenge yourself to reach new heights of mastery and become the ultimate gem-crushing champion.</p>

    <p>You have the option to interact with the gems in two distinct ways: either poke them with your fingertips for a tactile experience, or simply gaze at a gem and perform a pinch gesture to crack it. Choose the method that suits your mood and enjoy a seamless gaming experience.</p>
